K-Means Clustering 
--
I went through using the different datasets with the tutorial. For each dataset I had to rewrite the code to fit into the labels and parameters it was measuring for the K-Means clustering. It was interesting to see the different models in action -- I would probably try a K-Means plugin or another visualizer to see how the clusters are forming.

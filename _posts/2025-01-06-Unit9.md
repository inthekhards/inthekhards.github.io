title: Unit 9

CNN Algorithm
--
I believe using CNN algorithms for facial recognition is still dangerous, because there is a lot of potential for bias and errors (Wall, 2019). As the article stated, innocent people who look similar to criminals that are being scanned for can be falsely accused and identified by AI. There needs to be extensive training with datasets, and I believe this type of technology should be used with human supervision. 

Using the algorithm provided in the unit 9 eportfolio activity was helpful to understand how it works and for my future assignment. I changed the values for the test images and it correctly identified which category the image belonged to.

CNN Tutorial

For the CNN simulator on the browser, I found it to work surprisingly well. I uploaded my own images for the model to identify and sort through its layers, and it was fairly accurate with all of my images. 

Even when uploading dissimilar images, the model recognizes that it is something related to a category. For example, a capybara and a red panda.

I can see why CNN models are used for image recognition, but they can also make enough mistakes to not be a trustworthy tool to use for domestic security purposes.

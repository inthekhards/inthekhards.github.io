After reading Schwab's (2016) article on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, I believe the world is currently going through the growing pains of AI being introduced so suddenly in society. AI can be found in government, jobs, schools, and everyday commercial products and services. Leading tech companies like Apple have integrated AI into their phones, native apps, and computers to attract consumers and improve their products (Apple Inc., n.d.). The shift from COVID-19 lockdowns to AI probably contributes to the unknown and jarring feeling people have about this new technological revolution. One minute we are using Google, and the next we use AI to search and complete tasks for us. Although it feels new, AI and machine learning have been in development since the 1950s (Chai, 2020). First with the Turing Test, then we had our first chatbot, Eliza, in the 1960s. One case of an AI failure was when staff writers at CNET published articles using AI (Lohr, 2024). Although they wanted the AI to do the work for them, the AI-generated articles were full of errors, plagiarized content, and created fake references. The AI was making mistakes a human would not, because it was not trained in journalistic methodologies. This case showed that using generative AI for something that requires fact-checking and referencing can be dangerous. The generative AI model is working to create new and fabricated items to fulfill the prompt it is given.

Summary Post

In summary, the concept of Artificial Intelligence is not novel, as it has been in the making for a century. I would pinpoint OpenAI releasing Dall-E in 2018 for making generative AI, and the using of "AI", "Artificial Intelligence" and "ChatGPT" terminology mainstream (Chai, 2020). Often when having conversations with people online or in person, they refer to using AI as "ChatGPT" in the same way that people refer to searching as "Googling" or they will say, "Google it." It is remarkable how fast and impactful technology spreads to the general public and becomes a part of their vocabulary, as well as making it into the cultural and media zeitgeist. This leads to the idea that Schawb (2016) has been referring to machine learning and artificial intelligence as the 'Fourth Industrial Revolution', and I pointed out an example in my initial post with Apple. The negative side of this rapid advancement of technology is the increase in cybersecurity risks and attacks on people's devices and systems. Cyber-attacks are becoming more frequent and dangerous with the development of AI, data collection and machine learning (Jada and Mayayise: 2024). It is predicted that the monetary loss caused by cybercrimes could be worth 10.5 trillion dollars by next year, in 2025 (Jada and Mayayise, 2020: 1-2). The increased adoption of AI for systems has led to an uptick in vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks because there is an uphill battle with compatibility issues, outdated infrastructure, and legacy software not being able to update or scale (Jada and Mayayise, 2020: 7). Using AI to generate code or make decisions can also make errors, and it entirely depends on the quality of data and training that the AI has, to tailor it to the system it is being applied to. Regulating cybersecurity and AI has been recommended by both Schawb (2016) and Jada and Mayayise (2024). There needs to be an agreement and collective set of rules, or guides, to limit the number of risks or loss of data when trying to adopt AI into their systems.

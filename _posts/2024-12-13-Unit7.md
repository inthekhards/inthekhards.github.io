Perception Activities

For this activity, I ran the notebook tutorials going over the inputs, weights, arrays, and sigmoid function. The last tutorial about the sigmoid function, epochs and graphs had errors in it. I got stuck at one section of code, but I was able to see the results for the latter half and what the data should look like in this situation.

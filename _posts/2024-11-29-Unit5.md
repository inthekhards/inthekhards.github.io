title: Unit 5
---

In this unit, I learned about K-Means algorithm visualizations and learning about jaccard coefficient calculations. 

I used both Shabalin's (n.d.) and Harris' (2014) animation tools. I spent more time using Harris' tool from the eportfolio activity, looking at how different algoritims grouped their points in different ways. It had more variety in how it explained how K-Means algorithms work. I believe K-Means works best when you have already pre-processed or predict data will be similar enough for the model to group them together in clusters.

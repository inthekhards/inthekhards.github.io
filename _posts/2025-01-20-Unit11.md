Model Performance Measurement

I tried changing the parameters in the jupyter notebook for this activity. I was confused on how accuracy worked for this example of code, I did not know if the increase or decrease in numbers meant that the AUC and R2 error was improving.

After doing some research, it appears that the higher the number the more accurate it is. That is something for me to consider when building models using these parameters in the future.

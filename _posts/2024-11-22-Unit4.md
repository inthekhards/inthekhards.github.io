title: Unit 4
---
Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

Going through the tutorial for Unit 4 was helpful for me to learn how to set up and configure different plots, graphs, charts and ways to analyze data for my team project and future projects. Some of the code was running into errors with float values, which I had to fix. I found the correlation heatmap and pairplots using seaborn to be interesting.

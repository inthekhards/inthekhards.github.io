EDA Analysis
--

After completing the EDA analysis tutorial with train and test csv files, I attempted to analyze the auto-mpg csv and follow the seminar tasks for Unit 2. I was not able to find any missing values in the auto csv. It also would not go beyond the limit of 500 for a sample analysis. 

It took some troubleshooting to get the estimation and scatterplots done correctly, because I was encountering errors with float values -- which also happened with the train and test csv files.
